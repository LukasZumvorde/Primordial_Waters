* COMMENT TODOs
- replace campaign for another name that works both in german and english

#+LATEX: \newpage
* Introduction

Primordial waters is a generic, light, and abstract role playing rule set with a focus on keeping the game balanced while maintaining an even probalibity distribution and promoting creative story telling. It leans towards a cinematic play style.

** Goals

- Rules light
- Flexible
- World agnostic
- Consistent probability distribution
- Easy preparation
- Little bookkeeping

**** COMMENT Rules Light

The intend is for the rules to be as small as possible given the other goals. It should be easy to get into the game and easy to check the rules if you are not sure how a situation should be handled.

**** COMMENT Easy to Modify

It should be easy to create useful house rules to make the game fit your campaign.

**** COMMENT World Agnostic

The game should work with any game world or type of story reasonably well.

**** COMMENT Scalable characters

It should be possible to play both super-humans and commoners. It should also be possible to use the same rules to display rats vs humans or humans vs. giant spaceships. Imagine a giant space battle taking place outside and the group of players running around as mere humans performing acts of sabotage to tip the battle in their sides favor. 

**** COMMENT No action economy

It should be possible to do multiple things simultaneously in a round. It should be a trade off. This adds a new dimension of interesting decision making to the game.

**** COMMENT Constistent propability distribution

No matter how powerful a character is, The probability distribution for his die rolls should be consistent and allow for interesting scenarios to occur. It should still feel fair.

**** COMMENT Easy Preparation

The game should allow GMs to prepare new characters and challenges easily and quickly. It should get out of his way, but still support him in keeping the games balance.

**** COMMENT Creative Character Build

Players should be able to create nearly any character they like. It should also be possible to change the character at any point in the campaign to reflect the characters development. In this the rules should invite creativity and just ensure the games balance.

**** COMMENT Support interesting storys

The rules should support the creation of interesting and consistent storys by providing anker points for unexpected results.

**** COMMENT Keep Game Balance

In order for all to enjoy the game it must feel fair. Player characters need to feel similarly useful and encounters with NPCs or challenges must feel beatable but challenging.

**** COMMENT Rules Out of your way

The rules should be there to help you keep the games balance, but they should not prevent you from creating the story you want to create.

**** COMMENT No extensive Bookkeeping

The game should be playable without extensive bookkeeping. It should not be necessary to fill out a multiple pages long character sheet. During the game it should not be necessary to calculate or evaluate many values.

** Inspirations

This game did not come from nothing. Many other games had an impact on its creation. Some of the most impactfull ones are the following.:

This games systems for aspects and movement were heavily inspired from the Fate Core system.
Karma was originally inspired by Fate Cores Fate Points, but EZD6 had the better name for the concept.
The distribution of attributes into categories was inspired by the AERA RPG.
The fate die to create unexpected events was inspired by the One Page Solo RPG Engine.
The optional rule "Only Players Roll" is taken from the Cypher System.
The turn order was taken from Tides of Ambition.

** How to use the game

First rule of Gaming: Have fun. If the rules hinder you from having fun then screw the rules.

Second rule of Gaming: When in doubt use common sense. The rules will never be perfect. If something is illogical when using the rules or if no rules exists for the situation then feel free to find your own. 

Third rule of Gaming: Use the aspects value as a guideline and be creative with what it could mean. Does a flame wall having a value of 4 mean that it has a difficulty of 4 to jump over it or does it attack anyone jumping over with 4 dice? Do what fits your story. 


** Conventions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:conventions
:END:

*Dice shorthand*: $3 d 6$ means rolling three six sided dice and summing up the results. $1 d_0 2$ means rolling 1 dice whose sides go from 0 to 2 (three sides in total). $2 \times d_0 8$ means rolling a dice whose sides go from 0 to 8 and multiplying the result by 2.

*Aspects*: Aspects are highlighted like this \aspect{example aspect 3}. The tailing number indicates the value of the aspect. If an aspect has an additional number in square brackets, this denotes the [[#sec:aspects_resistant][resistance]] of the aspect.

All core rules can be found in =Quick Reference= blocks at the beginning of their respective sections. Everything else are just explainations and extensions of these rules.


** COMMENT What dice to roll

We use a number of $d_0 2$ to roll, although optional rules for [[#sec:alternativedicemechanics][alternative dice mechanics]] exist and are strongly recommended once you get the hang of things. Since it is hard to find dice with the sides 0, 1, and 2 I recommend 2 alternatives.

Option 1: Use a $d6$.
- 1 or 2 get interpreted as a 0
- 3 or 4 get interpreted as a 1
- 5 or 6 get interpreted as a 2

Option 2: Use Fate dice. Fate dice have 3 different kinds of sides. $+$, $-$ and nothing. Just count the number of lines. This means a $+$ becomes a 2, a $-$ becomes a 1 and an empty side becomes a $0$.

Sometimes it makes no sense to roll dice, but we want a constant value. Then we can [[#sec:checks_average][take the average]]. This means instead of rolling dice we just take the dice points as if it were the result of a roll. This is fair since it is also the average result of a roll.



#+LATEX: \newpage
* Rules

** Dice Mechanics
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:dice
:END:

#+begin_short
The dice points (DP) are calculated from the attributes and aspects. The dice you roll and how the result is determined is based on them.

Roll $F \times d_0 8 + c$ with $F = \lfloor \frac{DP}{4}$ (divide by 4 and round down) and $c = DP \mod{4}$ (divide by 4 and take the remainer). 
#+end_short

Based on your attributes and aspects you get dice points (see [[#sec:checks][checks]] for details). These dice points (DP) are used to decide what dice you roll for a check. 

- $1 d_0 2$ is worth exactly 1 dice point (this is the default)
- $1 d_0 N$ is worth $\frac{N}{2}$ dice points
- $1 d N$ is worth $\frac{N+1}{2}$ dice points
- a constant $N$ are worth $N$ dice points (generally you should limit this to $\frac{1}{4}$ of the dice points)
- Any dice multiplied by a factor $F$ is worth the price of a single dice multiplied by this factor $F$

The default is to use $F \cdot 1 d_0 8 + c$. This means that the factor $F$ is the dice points divided by $\frac{8}{2} = 4$ with c being the remainder. The players are free to use any other combination of dice they like as long as they don't exceed the dice points. Note that the more dice you roll the more predictable the results will be.

There are multiple ways to simulate $d_0 N$ dice. To simulate a ...
- $d_0 2$: take a $d6$ and count 1,2 as 0; 3,4 as 1; and 5,6 as 2.
- $d_0 2$: roll a fudge die (also known as fate dice). Count the empty sides as 0, count the "-" as 1 and "+" as 2. (essentially counting the number of lines.)
- $d_0 8$: roll a $d10$ (most actually go from 0 to 9). Reroll the die if you roll a 9.
- $d_0 N$ with $N \le 12$: Take a deck of cards. Count the queen as 0, ace as 1, numbers as they are, joker as 11, and king as 12. Discard any cards you dont need.

Sometimes it makes no sense to roll dice, but we want a constant value. Then we can [[#sec:checks_average][take the average]]. This means instead of rolling dice we just take the dice points as if it were the result of a roll. This is fair since it is also the average result of a roll.


** Attributes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:attributes
:END:

#+begin_short
There are the 8 attributes Strength, Dexterity, Will, Intellect, Empathy, Charisma, Gear, and Finances. Each attribute gets a whole number value.
#+end_short

Attributes describe a characters potential. The higher the value the greater things a character can achieve. There are the following 8 Attributes belonging to the 4 categories.

| *Category*  | *Attribute* | *Description*               |
|-----------+-----------+---------------------------|
| Physical  | Strength  | strength and hardiness    |
|           | Dexterity | agility, speed, precision |
|-----------+-----------+---------------------------|
| Mental    | Will      | perseverance, attention   |
|           | Intellect | intelligence, knowledge   |
|-----------+-----------+---------------------------|
| Social    | Empathy   | understanding people      |
|           | Charisma  | interacting with people   |
|-----------+-----------+---------------------------|
| Resources | Gear      | Gear you have prepared    |
|           | Finances  | Money and investments     |

The attributes value is the basis for the dice points one has available for [[#sec:checks][checks]]. 

** Aspects
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:aspects
:END:

#+begin_short
Aspects have a descriptive name and a whole number value called its aspect points (AP).
- Create: Make a check. The resulting AP are the AP of the new aspect.
- Use: Add the AP of the aspect to the check. Any AP can only be used once per round. 
- Multiple Targets: To create an aspect that effects an area or multiple targets half the AP.
- Duration: By default an aspect can be used once. To make it apply every round until the duration is over half the AP.
- Acting: Aspects can perform actions on their own. For this use the AP as the dice points.
- Remove: To remove an aspect you need to make a check. Reduce the AP of the aspect by the AP of the check.
- Resistance: Aspects can resist being removed. To reduce the AP of the check for removal by 1 for each resistance point. A point of resistance costs 1 AP.  
#+end_short


Aspects are a combination of a descriptors and a value. When invoked the aspects value is added or subtracted from the dice points  for [[#sec:checks][checks]]. An aspect is always bound to something. Be it a player, a NPC, an object or even a zone. Be creative with aspects. Try to bind their effects to the value and they should stay balanced enough.

**** Creating an Aspect

An aspect can be created at any time by the GM. It can also be created by any player, NPC or even object. To create an aspect all but the GM need to make a check. The aspect points (AP) from this check can be used to create an aspect. Increasing or decreasing an aspects value by 1 costs 1 AP (aspect point). The description of the aspect can be decided freely. 

#+begin_pwexample
Arthur the mage wants to inflame the grass around him to channel the enemies into a one on one battle with his Companions. The GM likes this idea and creates the aspect \aspect{Dry Grass 1} that Arthur can use. Arthur decides to cast his spell, succeeds with 3 AP, and creates the aspect \aspect{Wall of Fire 3}. Now any enemy has to either go around the wall or get burned. If an enemy tires to jump through, they have to roll on it against the fires 3 dice. If the fire succeeds they get burned.
#+end_pwexample

**** Using Aspects

Whenever it makes narrative sense an aspect can be used (also called invoked). When used an aspect adds its value to the number of points that can be used for a check. It is also possible to call out an aspect to be used to hinder a check. Then the value is subtracted from the points instead. An aspect can both be used for actions and reactions but never at the same time. If you use aspects in a contest make sure that aspects are not used more than once per round by a character or their points are distributed over different actions.

**** Area Aspects

An aspect can affect a zone. This means it can be invoked for all in the zone. To create such an aspect costs double the AP (aspect points). Exceptions may be made by the GM. 

**** Multiple Targets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:aspects_multiple_targets
:END:

If an aspect impacts multiple targets it costs double the AP (aspect points). Exceptions may be made by the GM.

**** Enduring Aspects
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:aspects_enduring
:END:

An aspect can be over within a round or it can last longer. Normally aspects last at least a scene long. If your aspect should last longer it should cost double the AP (aspect points). If it should only last for a round the costs half. Exceptions may be made by the GM. In general it can be said, that an aspect lasts as long as it makes sense.

**** Acting Aspects

Sometimes an aspect should perform actions on its own. Each round they can act like any other player or NPC. They use their value for their actions.

#+begin_pwexample
\aspect{Poison Cloud 2}: Each round it tries to use 2 dice to poison any inside. Since it impacts a zone it can do this for everyone inside the zone every round.
#+end_pwexample

**** Resistant Aspects
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:aspects_resistant
:END:

An aspect can have resistance to being removed. The resistance is subtracted from any attempt to removing this aspect. For each point of resistance costs 1. The effective resistance can never be more than the aspects value. Be creative when invoking a resistant aspect. For example armor could be implemented as an aspect with resistance.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment quote
#+begin_pwexample
A heavy door blocks the way. The GM creates the aspect \aspect{Fortified Door 5[2]}. This means the aspect has a value of 5 with a resistance of 2. The players try to break through with pure strength. On their first try they get 4 AP. 2 get absorbed by the doors resistance and the rest weakens the door. The doors aspect is now \aspect{Fortified Door 3[2]}. On their second try the players get 6 AP and break through.
If the players had decided to pick the lock the GM may had ignored the resistance value.
#+end_pwexample


**** Character Aspects

Aspects can also be bound to a character and be bought with CP (character points). If an aspect is mostly negative in nature it may give you CP instead. Character aspects can be invoked by the GM to make the character do something. 

**** Damage

Aspects are also used to represent damage a character or object has taken. If a character is unable to act in a scene because too many aspects hinder him, it is a good idea to narrate them out of the scene. It is also a good time to create a fitting negative character aspect representing this loss (like "lost an arm" or "fear of water" or "hateful of orcs").


** Checks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:checks
:END:

#+begin_short
Add points of attribute and aspects to get the dice points. Roll one or multiple dice that are equvalent to the dice points in value. The result of the roll are the aspect points (AP) of the check.
- Difficulty: Some aspects hinder a check. For them consider the AP to be negative instead. 
- Collaboration: Add either the dice points for the checks or the AP of all checks made together.
- Risky: Roll an additional $d6$. If it shows a $6$ then use the result of the check to create a negative aspect instead.
- Take Time: Make multiple checks and add the AP.
#+end_short

Checks are rolled when the outcome of an action is not certain. Each check is bound to an [[#sec:attributes][attribute]].

# The dice are rolled according to a modified dice pool system. Instead of rolling a number of dice directly we take the number and use the rules below to break it down to just 3 dice, that have to be rolled. The average result stays exactly the same but the propability distribution is more uniform this way.
# One gets a number of points equal to the sum off those from the attribute and applicable [[#sec:aspects][aspects]]. Distribute these point according to the rules.
# - You can never roll more than 3 dice (plus the one fate die).
# - If you have less than 3 points then roll 1 dice for each point.
# - Divide the number of points by 3 with a rest. The result is called the factor F and the rest of the division is called R.
# - Roll 3 six sided dice. Count a 1 and 2 as 0, count a 3 and 4 as 1 and count a 5 and 6 as 2. Alternatively roll fudge dice instead of d6, and count the number of lines.
# - Multiply the sum of the dice with the factor F and add the rest R. The result it your checks attribute points value (AP).

Add the points in the relevant attribute and all applicable [[#sec:aspects][aspects]] together. These are your dice points. You get the result of the roll in aspect points (AP).
# If the check had a difficulty subtract it from the AP.
If the aspect points are zero or negative the check fails.
# If the aspect points are exactly 0 the check succeeds at a cost. Create a negative aspect worth the factor F in AP.

**** Difficulty
# Difficulty reduces the number of aspect points. A good difficulty for a check is the sice of the dice pool P a player has. Reduce this by the factor F for easy checks and increase it by the factor F for hard checks.
The checks difficulty is the sum of all aspects that are to be overcome or created. This means that a door having the difficulty 3 to be opened is the same thing as the door having the aspect "Closed 3" on it. If an obstacle can not be partially overcome you can give it a [[#sec:aspects_resistant][resistant aspect]].

#+begin_pwexample
The player tries to pick a door lock. The GM decides that he can not partially pick a lock and thus chip away at the door. So he gives it the aspect \aspect{closed 1[5]}. This means that the player needs at least 6 AP to open it and has to do it with one check.
#+end_pwexample

**** Collaborative checks
Everyone rolls individually and then sum together all AP.

**** Risky checks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:risky
:END:

# If a check is risky the character might incur something bad if the check fails. If the check fails a negative aspect is created worth the difficulty in points. The minimum is 1. You can not take the average on a risky check.

# If the lowest possible value (die shows 0) is rolled on a risky check, then you reroll the check. This result is then used to create a negative aspect. 
 
# Roll an additional d6, called the risk die. If the risk die shows a 6 then the result of the check is used to create a negative aspect.

# Alternatively you can forego rolling a risky check all together, including the risk die, but then the result is always half of your dice points.

Roll the same dice you rolled for the check again. If these show a higher value then it comes to a bad outcome. The original check dice (not those for the risk check) are used to create a negative aspect.
Before the check one can reduce or heighten the risk. The outcome of the check roll can be reduced by a number, then the risk roll will be reduced by double that number. 
The chance of something bad happening is quite high (around 50%) unless you reduce the risk. If this is too  risky for your game then you can require two risk rolls instead. Something bad only happens if both risk rolls are higher (around 30%). 

**** Taking Time
Sometimes a check is to difficult to achieve something within 1 check. Then it may be possible to do multiple checks over a longer time to accumulate the points needed. However, you must decide beforehand how many checks you want to take. The AP of all checks are accumulated after considering the difficulty. The GM has a veto right and can limit the amount of checks.

**** Limited Aspects
To prevent players from stacking up aspects endlessly it may be good to limit the ammount of points one can use. The dice points should be limited to double the sum of the relevant attribute and all used aspect points from chracter inherent aspects. Feel free to disregard this rule however if it does not fit well with the story.

**** Multiple Checks
Sometimes the players fail to pass an obstacle with just one check. If the players have a new idea on how they might overcome the challenge then you can allow them another check. The new idea may add the checks AP to the previous attempt or replace them, depending on the narrative.

#+begin_pwexample
The player has to climb up a cliff. The cliff has the aspect \aspect{sheer rock face 6[2]} At frist he tires to just climb. He rolls a 3 on his check. This does not suffice and because of the 2 resistance of the aspect he has only overcome 1 of the 6 AP, he needs. This is harder than expected and considering that he has already climbed some of the distance a failure may end in a fall. He pulls out some wedges from his pack and starts to use them to create some better holds. For this the GM allows a new check, which he gets 7 AP from. With those he just barely climbs the rest of the distance.
#+end_pwexample

**** Take the average
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:checks_average
:END:
In some situations it may be good idea no to roll any dice at all. In those cases you can just assume that the average result was rolled. This means that you get the =dice points= in =AP= out of the check.

** Contest
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:contest
:END:

#+begin_short
Each participant can make one or more checks each round.
- Action: A check to create an aspect
- Reaction: A check to prevent an aspect from being created.
- Turn Order: From the one with the highest dice points to the one with the lowest. You can act on your turn or on any later point in the round.
- Multiple (re)actions: Total number of points (dice points) gained from the attributes is the largest attribute value of the checks. From each attribute (and aspect) you can use at most its value in points.
#+end_short

The prototypical contest is combat, but the same rules can be used any scenario where multiple parties act in opposition to each other. Be it a diplomatic debate or the hostile takeover of a company. 

A contest is divided into rounds. Each participant in the contest can make one or more checks each round. When it is a participants turn or on any later point in the round they can perform an action.

**** Actions
An action is a check that tries to create an aspect. Any kind of aspect can be created, based on what fits the scene. You can try to gain an advantageous position, or start a big fire.

If in combat, by default, the aspect that is created is \aspect{damage}. Damage is an [[#sec:aspects_enduring][enduring aspect]] thus costing 2 AP per level of the aspect. After combat \aspect{damage} gets converted to one or more fitting negative aspects like "broken leg" or "battered and bruised". 
Alternatively the aspect can be \aspect{stress} as a non enduring alernative to damage. \aspect{Stress} only holds for 1 round but cost only 1 AP per level of the aspect.

If a character has more \aspect{damage} than he has points in an applicable attribute and character aspects combined then he is considered incapacitated for the rest of combat. This may mean that he is unconcious, writhing in pain or just to demoralised to fight.

**** Reactions
Whenever someone takes an action and has rolled his dice anyone else can immediately try to perform a reaction to prevent it. A reaction does not by its nature create an aspect. If you announce this before the action is rolled you can take the average on a reaction. You have to announce the number of dice invested. The points from the reaction are then subtracted from the points of the action to lessen its effect.

**** Turn Order
The participants take turn from the one with the highest relevant attribute (+ aspects) to the lowest. On your turn you don't have to act. You can act at any point after you turn in the turn order. Even multiple times. 

Alternative:
- All characters of a party act together (typically all player characters or all enemies).
- If a party surprises the others then they go first.
- If a party has significantly less members, then they go first.
- If in doubt then determine the order by comparing the dice points of the parties. The highest one begins.

**** Multiple (re)actions
Each round you can take multiple actions and reactions. The total number of points gained from the attributes is the largest attribute value of the checks. From each attribute you can use at most its value in points in total. Each Aspect can only be used once or their AP (attribute points) have to be distributed to the (re)actions.

**** Acting together
When acting together all values are combined and a single combined check is made or alternatively everyone rolls seperately and only the AP are combined. To act together all have to act at the same time in the turn order, so effectively at the earliest when the slowest has his turn.

** Traits
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:traits
:END:

#+begin_short
Traits allow characters to break rules in some way. Some checks that can only be performed because of a trait make those checks [[#sec:risky][risky]]. Traits can be bought for character points.
#+end_short

Traits are distinguishing things about the character that allow him to break a rule of the world or the game in some way. For example with the Trait Night Vision you can just see in the dark. No rolls required. Some traits (like all magic) should come with a risk, meaning all checks that can only be made with this trait are risky checks. They can be bought for character points, this is possible both at character creation and later in the game.

See the chapter [[#sec:lotraits][List of Traits]] for examples.

** Karma
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:karma
:END:

#+begin_short
Each player can have up to 3 karma. They can be used at any point in time to repeat a single die roll (not just your own) or to add an interesting aspect to a scene. The GM has veto rights. Karma can be recovered by a characters aspect or trait being used against them or by objectively failing in a scene or as a reward for good role play (anything that brings joy to all players and the GM). 
#+end_short


** Character Creation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:charactercreation
:END:

#+begin_short
Distribute 150 CP on your Attributes, Aspects and Traits.

Use the rules under equipment to limit your starting gear.

Character Advancement:
You may reward your players with CP (character points) for reaching milestones in the story or simply surviving the session.

- An attribute point costs 6 CP.
- An Aspect point typically costs 6 CP but can vary based on how specific they are.
- A Trait typically costs 15 CP but can vary widely. Negative traits can even have a negative price.

A typical player character will have:
- all attributes with value 2 on average
- 3 aspects with value 2
- 1 trait
#+end_short

** Movement and Range
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:movement
:END:

#+begin_short
Sometimes it is useful to draw maps and define distances. In a contest split the area into roughly 3-5 zones. A character can move from one zone to another each round. If one can act at a range, like for example when shooting a bow, one can act 1-2 zones far. During the round a character is moving he can be considered to be in both zones at once.
#+end_short

** Items and Equipment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:items
:END:

Items have a description and a resource value (RV). The RV is an abstraction for the items price or usefulness. 
Items may have an aspect associated with them. If you want items to have any specific effects you may add aspects. At any time the GM can choose to give an item an aspect. Normally it will have the resource value of the item in AP. You don't have to write down the obvious aspects an item has. For example you dont need to specify that the sword is good for slicing stuff.

# The RV (Resource Value) of an Item determines how expensive or hard to get it is. Items also have a description and maybe special effects. Let your fantasy go wild.
# The aspects an item has should not exceed its RV in AP.

**** Armor / Damage Reduction
There is no Armor but some aspects can act as such. If an aspect can be used in a defensive (re)action, this effectively reduces the amount of AP of the attack. Thus they act like armor. Think of armor items as having the protective aspect on them. If an aspect can be used is up to the GM. So he can decide that the very expensive ballgown can not be used to defend against a bullet.

**** Equipment
Characters can have gear with a value of up to the attribute Gear in RV on them. They must be able to carry all that gear on them or if it is part of their household it must fit in their normally furnished home. Apply reason as necessary.

When out adventuring characters have all the gear that they have written down. Additionally they can be allowed to make a Gear check against the RV of what they would like to have in the moment to see if they do. The check is risky and if they fail they get the negative aspect "Packed the wrong stuff" until the end of the mission or until they resupply. 

**** Buying

Characters can buy new items with a Finances check. It works just like crafting an aspect with the resource value (RV) in aspect points (AP). If you succeed in buying the item then you take a negative aspect on your finances for some time. The GM does not have to let you retry on a fail. If you use items with aspects to do this like the "Treasure" you found during your last adventure you may lose them if you succeed on the check.
# Characters can buy new items with a Finances check. The check is risky. The bought item can be treated like an aspect that is created with this check. The GM does not have to let you retry on a fail. If you use items with aspects to do this like the "Treasure" you found during your last adventure you may lose them if you succeed on the check.

**** Crafting
Characters can also build their own items. For that they need the appropriate tools and resources. The resources may be bought and have a RV of the item to be build minus 1. To build the item the character needs to make a check and achieve at least the items RV in AP. If that fails the resources might be lost, depending on what they are.

**** Gathering
Resources can be gathered with a check and their RV as difficulty.

**** Describe
To create an item first give it a short description. Second you determine its value if applicable. Add aspects if applicable. The sum of the aspects AP should not exceed the RV.

**** Bribing
To Bribe someone you need to give them more than they can normally comfortably afford. This means you need more than their finances value in RV to bribe them.

* Optional Rules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:optionalrules
:END:

** Magic

Magic gives a huge narrative flexibility to explain aspects. To balance this out any checks made using magic should be [[#sec:risky][risky checks]].
# This means the value of the created aspects has to be defined beforehand. This is taken as the difficulty of the check. If the check fails the magician creates an unwanted likely negative aspect at the value of the difficulty. If he succeeds the created aspect has exactly the predefined value.
Depending on the setting, a trait might be necessary to cast magic or even a specific kind of magic.

With this magic can still become quite powerful, since one can create several aspects and combine them for bigger spells. For example a mage might make special conjuration candles, draw a pentagram with magic symbols and then use those two aspect to assist in his conjuration spell.

It is up to the individual games setting to define how magic works. By themselves the rules above give a very soft magic system, but by defining how magic works in your world, you can make it a hard magic system. 

** Less precise Attributes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:less_precise_attributes
:END:

Instead of using the attributes as listed you can use only the categories (Physical, Mental, Social, Resources). Learning a level in one of the categories costs double of what a level in an attribute would cost.
For GMs it might even be useful to combine all attributes into a single value called the capability (CB) for some NPCs. In this case the costs are 8 times that of what a level in an attribute would cost.

** No Abstraction for Wealth

To remove the resources category from the attributes just raise the price of learning a level of the other attributes by $\frac{1}{3}$ (from 6 to 8). The costs for goods and services
depend on the campaign setting.

** Retroactive Actions

The GM may allow players retroactively having performed some action. For example having placed a trap beforehand. To balance this any check on such an action should be a [[#sec:risky][risky check]].

** Quicker Battles

Instead of differentiating between attacking and blocking you can speed up combat by handling it all as generic combat. If someone initiates combat with his action, others may react with combat in return. Whoever wins the contest makes the difference as a damaging aspect.

** COMMENT Easier Calculations

If you reach bigger dice points then the calculations may become bothersome. One way to deal with this is to normalize the factors. What this means is make all parties use the same factor. To achieve this just take the smallest factor and reduce all other factors to it. For each reduction of the factor the remainder increases by 3. This changes the probability distribution a bit by making very low and very high results impossible, but the advantage is that opposing dice results can cancel each other out,


# ** Options on what to do with the dice pool
# - Roll on a d{0,1,2} per 1 dice in pool and sum the results
# - Take dice pool as AP
# - Roll on a d{0,.., 2*n} per n dice in the pool and sum the results
# - Take any other option and reduce its cost by n by taking -n AP
# - Any combination of the options above

** Only Players Roll
If you like you can generally let only players roll the dice. Everyone else will take the average result. This means that in combat only players will roll to hit or roll to block.

** Unexpected Results
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:unexpectedresults
:END:

Assuming you play with a set of cards. Add the two jokers to the deck. If a joker is drawn then draw again and resolve the check normally. Afterwards, if the joker was red create an aspect worth the difficulty of the check in AP to the characters disadvantage. If the joker was black create create an advantageous aspect instead. The new aspect does not have to be related to the check.
If a complication has appeared in the scene already you may ignore a joker (GMs choice).

# You roll an additional d6, called the fate die. On a 1 you add a "but .." and create an additional aspect worth the factor F in points that counteracts the result somewhat. On a 6 you add a "and .." and create an additional aspect worth the factor F in points that enhances the result somewhat. The extra die can also be rerolled with a fate point or advantage on the check.

# #+begin_quote

# #+begin_quote

# Aspect: Covered in Blood 2.
# #+end_quote

** COMMENT Alternative Dice Mechanics
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:alternativedicemechanics
:END:

The rules often mention a dice points. If you always used a number of $d_0 2$ to perform any check this would be your dice pool. A $d_0 2$ has an average result of $1$. Therefore the dice in the dice pool is always exactly the average result of a check. This does not mean you have to roll your checks in that way. See the following for alternatives.

*** Shorthand notation

A $F \cdot N d_0 X$ means rolling dice with $0$ to $X$ as possible results $N$ times, and adding the results, multiplying the result with $F$. Since there are very few dice that that have a 0 as a possible result you can use other methods to get the result. I suggest to draw a playing card.

*** COMMENT Playing cards instead of dice

To use Playing cards instead of dice you can do the following. Take a standard 54 card deck of playing cards. Remove the 2 Jokers from it. Shuffle and pick a card. If it is a number then take the number as a result. Aces count as 1. Jacks count as 11, Kings count as 12. Queens count as 0 since Q looks most like a 0.


*** COMMENT Alternative Dice

- $1 d_0 2$ is worth exactly 1 dice point (this is the default)
- $1 d_0 N$ is worth $\frac{N}{2}$ dice points
- $1 d N$ is worth $\frac{N+1}{2}$ dice points
- Take the average: $N$ constant points is worth $N$ dice points ($N$ may be negative)
- Any dice multiplied by a factor $F$ is worth the price of a single dice multiplied by this factor $F$

The default is to use $F \cdot 1 d_0 8 + c$. This means that the factor $F$ is the dice points divided by $\frac{8}{2} = 4$ with c being the remainder. The players are free to use any other combination of dice they like as long as they don't exceed the dice points. Note that the more dice you roll the more predictable the results will be.

One way to do this is to use a d10 die. Most of them start are actually a $d_0 9$. You can use it as a $d_0 8$ by ignoring any 9 that is rolled or if you use the [[#sec:unexpectedresults][Unexpected Results]] optional rules, treat a 9 as if it were a joker.

If you don't =take the average= then it is advisable to keep the constant points between $-\frac{N}{2}$ and $+\frac{N}{2}$, to keep the window of possible results wide.

* Advice
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:advice
:END:

** Gameplay Notes

Since aspects can appear, disappear and change frequently during play, it is good to write them down and show them to your players. For this i suggest to use post-it notes. This has the nice effect that you can give your players something physical that represents the advantages they created or can use.

** Player Character Creation

When creating a character you may adhere these guidelines:
- No attribute above 6
- No attribute below 2
- Have 1 aspect describing what you want to be good at
- Have 1 aspect describing how you make your living
- Have 1 aspect describing what you like to do as a hubby
- Forumlate your traits and aspects such that they can be interpreted as a vulnerability
- Have at least 1 trait
Break these guidelines as you like.

** Non-Player-Character Creation

Often you dont need highly specific attributes. Use [[#sec:less_precise_attributes][less precise attributes]] unless you realy need more precision.
- Define competency value (or attributes)
- Have at least 1 aspect that describes a strength (for combat encounters)
- Have at least 1 aspect that describes a weakness (for combat encounters)
- Have at least 1 aspect that describes a desire (for social encounters)
- Have at least 1 aspect that describes a vice (for social encounters)
If you keep the positive and negative aspects balanced, then the math for the CP is only about the competency value, which is roughly 50 CP per point.
  
** Encounter Design

The challenge value (CV) is a number servig as a quick reference for how hard aspects to overcome should be or how strog enemies should be, When creating aspects that the players must overcome use the CV as the AP (aspect points). Then creating enemies that the players must fight set their Competence or attribute to the CV.
- For static challenges, the players CP divided by 25 is a good challenge value.
- For group challenges, the sum of all players CP dividec by 25 is a good challenge value.
- For contests match the enemies total CP with that of the players.
- Let your players become creative and create aspects to help them better their odds.
- Try to give any noteworthy opponent an advantageous and a disadvantageous aspect. Give the players a chance to find out about those.

** How to Rule: Stealth as a Group

Only roll the checks for the players and take the average for everyone else. Compare the sneaking of each from the one party to the perception of each from the other party. If any perception is higher than any of the sneaking values then they get spotted.
Often times the characters in the party help each other. Let them distribute some points within the group after they rolled their checks. This represents something like the best scout sneaking ahead and finding the best route for the others, or distracting a guard such that the more obvious members of the party can pass unnoticed.

** How to Rule: Taunting
Let the player make a check to create the "taunted by .." aspect. This may be opposed by the other party. If the aspect is created then it hinders any attack on someone else. It may also impact other actions. It may be a smart choice to make the "taunted by .." aspect [[#sec:aspects_enduring][enduring]] and [[#sec:aspects_multiple_targets][affecting the whole group]]. 

# ** COMMENT How to Rule: Extremely Small Creatures
# Lets say a player turns himself into a mouse. How does this impact his strength, dexterity and intellect? In most cases being a mouse is just an aspect on the player (here it is "mouse form 5"). Lets say the player has a value of 3 in all 

# Checks with zero or negative dice points. Shift the dice pool for the check up until it reaches 1. Perform the same shift for the reaction. If multiple parties participate 

# If a dice pool turns negative it does not mean that you can not roll. Checks are really just a comparison between the rolled AP and either the AP oposing force. By default it is 0.  

** How to Rule: Mind Control
Mind control is similar to taunting. Create an aspect like \aspect{Mind Controlled by ..}. Any actions that would conflict with this aspect are hindered by it (for example attacking the controller). If the mind control is stronger than the victims will then it will generally follow orders. The victim may try to break free each round. For this it makes a will check to remove the \aspect{Mind Controlled by} aspect.

#+begin_pwexample
Marty the mage casts his mind control spell on an orc bandit with the words "Fight for me". Marty has 9 AP from his check, while the orc has only 3 to defend against this. This means that Marty can create the aspect with 6 AP. Since he wanted an [[#sec:aspects_enduring][enduring aspect]] he creates \aspect{Fight for Marty 3}, The orc has only 3 Will, so he starts attacking his compatriouts. 
#+end_pwexample

** How to Rule: Healing
Healing is just reducing a negative aspect. Whether this is possible, and by what means is up to the GM. Instead of removing the aspect immediately, i would strongly suggest to instead make the aspect time out faster. In most cases think about the timeframes in terms of the flow of the story.
- Round: Until just after the next round of combat or action is going to be performed.
- Scene: Until the next scene begins
- Mission: Until the current objective is achieved or failed
- Kampaign: Until the next big change in the story.

#+begin_pwexample
A Soldier got hit in a firefight and is now \aspect{bleeding 2}. If untreated this aspect would regularly roll with 2 dice points to harm the soldier. The medic rolls to perform first aid and gets a result of 3. He aspect gets changed into \aspect{dressed bullet wound 2}. Now it does not thread to harm the soldier any more, but it still hinders him. It would heal in about 4-6 Months on its own. The soldier gets brought to a hospital where the wound is treated propperly. It heals after 3 Weeks. 
#+end_pwexample

#+begin_pwexample
The party had a hard fight against the cultists. One got punched, he will recover by the next scene. Another got hit with a sword. He will recover by the end of the current mission (once they are done with the cultists secret temple). The last got cut with the demonic ritual dagger. His wound is unearthly and would only heal by the end of the kampaign. The group decides to seek out the help of the solarian church. With their help the demonic presense gets purged  and the wound turned into a regular cut, which heals by the end of the current mission.
#+end_pwexample

** How to Rule: Stopping Movement
If one character wants to move and someone else tries to hinder them, then both parties have to exert effort. This means both have to make a check. The results are compared. If the stopper has more then the movement is stopped, where appropriate. If the mover succeeds then the movement is not stopped. Sometimes it may be better to grant partial success to the stopper. In this case the distance that the mover moved is reduced accoring to how much AP both parties have compared to each other.

** Example: Ambushed by Goblins

*GM* is the Game Master Mathew controlling the 3 goblins (P: 2, M; 1, S: 1, Life of Banditry 1)

*A* is the player Anna with her character Amy (P: 3,M: 6,S: 4, Proud member of the Alchemists Guild of Mistwater 3)

*B* is the player Ben with his character Boris (P: 6,M: 4,S: 3, Best Fighter of his tribe and wrestling champion 3, Member of the isolated Nomads of the eastern steppes 2)

*GM:* As you walk along the forest trail please roll for perception with your will.
- GM rolls 6d = 4 for the 3 goblins trying to ambush
- A rolls 4d =  4
- B rolls 6d = 10

*GM:* You notice a shuffling in the bushes before you reach the choke-point. You exchange a quick look with one another and know that the Goblins must be here. 

*B:* I try to intimidate the goblins in order to prevent them from attacking us. I step forward as if there was nothing there and say to Amy "Remember the Wivern we killed last week. Turns out it ate one of the royal knights. What total weaklings they must have been. I mean we ripped that lizards fucking head of without breaking a sweat."

*GM:* roll for intimidation with charisma, you can use your barbarian aspect for it. The story sounds very much like what a barbarian would do.
- B rolls 6d = 2
- GM rolls 3d = 5

*GM:* They block with their empathy. Sorry Ben, the goblins are not convinced. They jump out of the bushes.

*A:* Can i have prepared a smoke bomb?

*GM:* Ok, make a retroactive check for your alchemy.
- A rolls 9d = 6 with an "and"

*A:* It should cover an area with smoke. For the and, how about it also causes coughing.

*GM:* Sounds good. As i said the goblins jump out of the bushes and attack, still thinking that you don't expect them. Lets start the turn order. Anna, Ben you go first. Since you have equal values decide among yourself who begins.

*A:* I throw the bomb at them. I use 1d and the smoke bomb. I want it to cover a zone.
- A rolls 7d = 5 => the smoke aspect has strength 5/2 = 2

*GM:* The goblins dont expect this and dont try to defend. I will add \aspect{covered in irritating smoke 2} to them.

*B:* I attack with my axe. I use 3 of my strength dice and my fighting aspect.
- B rolls 6d = 0 "and"

*GM:* During the attack you step partially into the smoke and breathe in some of it. I give you the aspect \aspect{coughing 2}. The goblins attack. They rolled 5 please defend ben.
- GM rolls 9d-2d = 7d = 5

*A:* I want to assist in bens defense.
- A rolls 2d = 3
- B rolls 6d-2d = 4d = 3

*GM:* Together you manage to defend with 6 against 5. Next round. It is your turn.

*B:* I attack
- B rolls 4d + 3 = 9
- GM rolls 7d = 4

*GM:* You kill two of them outright.

*A:* I attack the remaining one.
- A rolls 3d = 1

*GM:* After this. He will try to flee.

*A:* "Let him run"

*GM:* The goblin runs away and soon the smoke dissipates and the street is silent once more.

** COMMENT Example: Hacker duel

** COMMENT Example: Court Case

** Example: The Ambush

The players are preparing an ambush on a patrol. The GM describes the scene

*GM:* You know that the patrol is going to pass through this area, using the small forrest path. It is barely wide enough for a single cart and shallow ruts in the road indicate that the path is only used ocasionally. The underbrush is thick in some parts, but there are also stretches of dark pine forrest. Because of the recent rains there are mud puddles everywhere.

He creates some aspects
- \aspect{shallow ruts 1}
- \aspect{narrow path 1}
- \aspect{thick underbrush 1}
- \aspect{dark shadows under the pines 1}
- \aspect{muddy ground 1}

The players will prepare the ambush. For this they can make as many checks to create aspects as they have time to do.

*R:* As a ranger i am good in nature and will select the best spot for the ambush. It should be especially narrow such that they can not maneuver well. The ground should be muddy and i want particularly dark shadows to cover us, but not the enemy.

*GM:* So no \aspect{shallow ruts} and no \aspect{thick underbush}?

*R:* The \aspect{ruts} are fine, but i dont want us to be hindered by the \aspect{underbrush}.

*GM:* Yes, that is possible. You can use the \aspect{dark shadows} and \aspect{muddy ground} to prepare the spot. Make the intelect check.

*R:* I have 3 from my attribute and 3 from being a ranger. [rolls $1 d_0 8 + 2 = 6 + 2$ on the check] I have 8AP. I would like the aspect to last the entire scene [AP / 2] and apply to all of us [AP / 2].

He writes the aspect on a postit and places it on the table
- \aspect{Well prepared Ambush 2}
The GM takes the unused aspects back of the table. What is left are
- \aspect{shallow ruts 1}
- \aspect{narrow path 1}
- \aspect{dark shadows under the pines 1}
- \aspect{muddy ground 1}

*A:* As an Alchemist i would like to prepare a fire bomb at the spot of the ambush. As we establishes last time i should have all the ingredients.

*GM:* With the muddy ground it will be hard to ignite the bomb.

*A:* Fine. I can still do it. 4 from my intelect and 3 from being an alchemist.

*GM:* Dont forget to hide the thing.

*T:* As a reformed thief i will help him with that. 2 from intelect and 3 from thievery [rolls $1 d_0 8 + 1 = 6$].

*A:* [rolls $2 d_8 - 1 = 2*7 -1 = 13$] Oh, that is going to hurt. I want all of them to be affected [AP / 2].

The players create the aspects
- \aspect{Fire bomb 6}
- \aspect{Well hidden 6}
As they see the numbers fitting so well they replace the aspects with
- \aspect{Well hidden fire bomb 6}

*D:* My druidic circle specialises in turning into a bear for fighting. So i will shape shift and lie in wait. 4 will and 2 druidry plus 1 from my speciality in shape shifting [rolls $2 d_0 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$]. That is not going to be convincing.

*GM:* You dont quite turn into a bear. Instead you become much more hary and a bit stronger.

*D*: Can i at least hide?

*GM:* No need. We will roll that check collectively later.

The druid gets the aspect
- \aspect{Bear'ish form 1}

The preparations are done, and the GM narates how the patrol comes down the road.

*GM:* Lets see if they can spot you. Is a collective check okay for all of you?

*All*: Yes

*A*: I have only 3 points, but 2 more from the well prepared ambush makes 5 in total.

*T*: 6 from me.

*D:* I can contribute 5. Does my fur help with hiding?

*GM:* yes, it helps.

*D*: Then 6 from me as well.

*R*: I contribute 7. That makes 24 in total. [rolls $6 d_0 8 = 24$]

*GM*: That makes 6 on average. The 5 soldiers have 4 each so they are surprised 2 (6 - 4 = 2) by your attack. You are still unnoticed as they reach the trap.

The GM creates the aspect
- \aspect{Surprised 2}

*GM*: Let the combat scene begin.

*A:* Kaboom

*GM:* Indeed. The bomb explodes. Lets see if any one notices [rolls $1 d_0 8 - 1$ each with the results 3,2,7,7,6 and compares this to the bomb being hidden]. Just two notice the smell of sulphur and try to evade [rolls $1 d_0 8 - 3$ for both with results 2,1 and compares this to the bomb damage]. They all take a lot of damage. Three of them go down immediately. Two try to stand up.

*R:* I shoot one of them [rolls $1 d_0 8 + 3 = 10$].

*T:* And i the other [rolls $1 d_0 8 + 1 = 4$]

*GM:* They are both dead. Congratulations it all worked perfectly. Lets hope the others did not hear the explosion.

*All*: Oh no.

* Solo Rules

** Scene
Roll on the Scene type table to find out what kind of scene it is.

For at least 3 descriptors roll on the descriptor table. If you have consecutive scenes then i advise to roll only 1 new descriptor and remove only the first of the previous scene. This will make your encounters more connected to one another.

#+LATEX: \begin{multicols}{2}
Lead questions for Scenes: 
- Who/What?
- Does What?
- To whom?
- In what manner? 
#+LATEX: \columnbreak
Lead questions for NPCs:
- Personality?
- Desires?
- Has Vice?
- Has Virtue?
#+LATEX: \end{multicols}

Determine the scenes challenge rating.
- Start with your players $\frac{CP * 3}{100}$.
- For a successfull scene increase the challenge rating by 1
- For a failed scene decrease the challenge rating by 3

This will result in a natural ebb and flow for the story which favors the players being able to succeed. If you want a harder experience change the factors by which you change the challenge rating. 
The challenge rating is the default difficulty for environmental challenges and the default total competency of all enemies in combat encounters.

Add aspects to the scene or anything in it, based on the descriptors.

** Descriptors

Ask you question and roll as often on the descriptor table as you need to get a good idea. Feel free to disregard meaning that dont work for you.
The descriptor table is based on the Toki Pona language. The second column provides you with the applicable toki pona word and gives you a short form to write it down.

* COMMENT Scenario: The Endless Underground
- An endless underground city.
- Older than known history
- Endless to the best knowledge of any known inhabitant
- Myths about a place called overground. A place without a ceiling
- countless factions live in the city.#
- Some build new rooms and tunnels but most just reuse the existing ones.
- Some plants (and mushrooms) can gain energy from heat, water and minerals.
- Some plants give light
- Many plants produce oxigen (just like overground)
- Underground denisens
  - Dwarfs
  - Orks
  - Goblins
  - Drow
  - Spiders
  - Bugs
  - Reptiles
  - 


* Scenario: X-Files meets cold war

** Rules

Players can access the resources of their respective Organisation. When they do this they can invoke the aspects of the organisation. The organisation can also act on its own.

Since the players may only have a limited influence to access the resources of the organisation they can only get a limited ammount of help per mission. The value of the abstract =authority in <organisation>=  is this limiting factor. This value is not bought but earned. The GM may award a point to this aspect at the end of a session. The aspect is not bound to a single player character but the entire group. The aspect starts at the value 2. 



Sometimes the characters will encounter the mystical. The mythstical can be experienced by everyone but the world has a strong tendency to obfuscate it. Anyone who hinders it in doing so will be cursed with evil things. Those who aid it will sometimes be blessed, but only while in the pursuit of obfuscation. No one knows why this is.

Aspect: Cursed
A cursed person may be befallen with disease, bad luck or find himself disliked and not believed by others. The curse tends to disappear as less and less people believe in what ever was revealed.

Apsect: Blessed
A blessed person may use the AP from the blessing (once per point) to aid in his actions. 

This is also the reason why all organisations dealing with the supernatural tend to be very secretive, small and compartmentalised. Often operators and soldiers know only the bear minimum they need to. 

The supernatural creatures are also impacted by this. The universe itself is fighting against these invaders, which bring its internal logic into question. However the supernatural exists and tries to stay alive or even in some cases bring ruin to the universe itself (for example eldrich gods)

** Organisations

* Scenario: WW1 in Fantasy

The world is inhabitated by all the typical humanoid races you find in fantasy. They are mostly races of Humanity, meaning that crossbreeding is possible, albeit in some cases may be rare. Magic is a comparatively rare thing. In ancient times it was more prominent, but over the centuries the weave of magic became thinner and thinner. All the big nations and kingdoms are mostly homogenous with respect to the race of their citizens. 

Technologically the world is comparable to the time of the first world war mixed with steampunk elements.

Recently the world has become very tumultuous. Most nations are at war with one another. Alliances are fleeting and the tides of war are constantly shifting. The Nations of the world are not striktly separated by race. So a typical mixed group of players could be from anywhere. 

The following assumes the group to play spies or gangsters.

World Aspects:
- Thin magic weave 3
- The tides of war are constantly shifting 2

- The institute of archane studies sits in a network of buildings litteres throughout the city.
- The institute provides weapons to the military and uses the Orphans to build some of them. The brains of the children are extracted and used as guidance systems for bombs.

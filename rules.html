<h2 id="org25eab32"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Primordial waters is a generic, light, and abstract role playing rule set with a focus on keeping the game balanced while maintaining and even promoting creative story telling. It leans towards a cinematic play style.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org065fd07" class="outline-3">

<div id="outline-container-org2d2a103" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org2d2a103">Rules Light</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2d2a103">
<p>
The intend is for the rules to be as small as possible given the other goals. It should be easy to get into the game and easy to check the rules if you are not sure how a situation should be handled.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgebe1992" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgebe1992">Easy to Modify</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgebe1992">
<p>
It should be easy to create useful house rules to make the game fit your campaign.

<div id="outline-container-orgab517a9" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgab517a9">World Agnostic</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgab517a9">
<p>
The game should work with any game world or type of story reasonably well.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb74cde9" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgb74cde9">Scalable characters</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb74cde9">
<p>
It should be possible to play both super-humans and commoners. It should also be possible to use the same rules to display rats vs humans or humans vs. giant spaceships. Imagine a giant space battle taking place outside and the group of players running around as mere humans performing acts of sabotage to tip the battle in their sides favor. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org940e976" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org940e976">No action economy</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org940e976">
<p>
It should be possible to do multiple things simultaneously in a round. It should be a trade off. This adds a new dimension of interesting decision making to the game.

<div id="outline-container-org7806d2f" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org7806d2f">Constistent propability distribution</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7806d2f">
<p>
No matter how powerful a character is, The probability distribution for his die rolls should be consistent and allow for interesting scenarios to occur. It should still feel fair.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org95bb39d" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org95bb39d">Easy Preparation</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org95bb39d">
<p>
The game should allow GMs to prepare new characters and challenges easily and quickly. It should get out of his way, but still support him in keeping the games balance.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge756f0c" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orge756f0c">Creative Character Build</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge756f0c">
<p>
Players should be able to create nearly any character they like. It should also be possible to change the character at any point in the campaign to reflect the characters development. In this the rules should invite creativity and just ensure the games balance.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9f9f7d2" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org9f9f7d2">Support interesting storys</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9f9f7d2">
<p>
The rules should support the creation of interesting and consistent storys by providing anker points for unexpected results.

<h5 id="org595a6a5">Keep Game Balance</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org595a6a5">
<p>
In order for all to enjoy the game it must feel fair. Player characters need to feel similarly useful and encounters with NPCs or challenges must feel beatable but challenging.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org59d3e61" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org59d3e61">Rules Out of your way</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org59d3e61">
<p>
The rules should be there to help you keep the games balance, but they should not prevent you from creating the story you want to create.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9fcc64e" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org9fcc64e">No extensive Bookkeeping</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9fcc64e">
<p>
The game should be playable without extensive bookkeeping. IT should not be necessary to fill out a multiple pages long character sheet. During the game it should not be necessary to calculate or evaluate many values.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6466bab" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6466bab"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Inspirations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
This game did not come from nothing. Many other games had an impact on its creation. Some of the most impact full ones are the following.
</p>

<p>
This games systems for aspects and movement were heavily inspired from the Fate Core system.
Karma was originally inspired by Fate Cores Fate Points, but EZD6 had the better name for the concept.
The distribution of attributes into categories was inspired by the AERA RPG.
The fate die to create unexpected events was inspired by the One Page Solo RPG Engine.
The optional rule "Only Players Roll" is taken from the Cypher System.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfbf5150" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfbf5150"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> How to use the game</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
First rule of Gaming: Have fun. If the rules hinder you from having fun then screw the rules.
</p>

<p>
Second rule of Gaming: When in doubt use common sense. The rules will never be perfect. If something is illogical when using the rules or if no rules exists for the situation then feel free to find your own ruling. 
</p>

<p>
Third rule of Gaming: Use the aspects value as a guideline and be creative with what it could mean. Does a flame wall having a value of 4 mean that it has a difficulty of 4 to jump over it or does it attack anyone jumping over with 4 dice? Do what fits your story. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org8b6ebbc" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8b6ebbc"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Conventions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
In the book we use the following shorthands.
</p>

<p>
A \(N d_0 X\) means rolling dice with 0 to X as possible results N times and adding the results. Since there are very few dice that that have a 0 as a possible result you can use other methods to get the result. I suggest to draw a playing card.
</p>

<p>
To use Playing cards instead of dice you can do the following. Take a standard 54 card deck of playing cards. Remove the 2 Jokers from it. Shuffle and pick a card. If it is a number then take the number as a result. Aces count as 1. Jacks count as 11, Kings count as 12. Queens count as 0 since Q looks most like a 0.
</p>

<p>
The rules often mention a dice pool. This pool is hypothetical. It means if you always used a number of  \(d_0 2\) to perform any check this would be your dice pool. A \(d_0 2\) has an average result of \(1\). Therefore the dice in the dice pool is always exactly the average result of a check. This does not mean you have to roll your checks in that way.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec:dice" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec:dice"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> What dice to roll</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec:dice">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(1 d_0 2\) is worth exactly 1 dice from the pool (this is the default)</li>
<li>\(1 d_0 N\) is worth \(\frac{N}{2}\) dice from the pool</li>
<li>\(1 d N\) is worth \(\frac{N+1}{2}\) dice from the pool</li>
<li>Take the average: \(N\) constant points is worth \(N\) dice from the pool</li>
<li>Any dice multiplied by a factor \(F\) is worth the price of a single dice multiplied by this factor \(F\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default is to use \(F \times 3 d_0 2 + c\). This means that the factor \(F\) is the dice pool divided by 3 with c being the remainder. The players are free to use any other combination of dice they like as long as they don't exceed the dice pool.

<h3 id="sec:aspects"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Aspects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec:aspects">
<p>
Aspects are a combination of a descriptors and a value. When invoked the aspects value is added or subtracted from the number of dice rolled for <a href="#sec:checks">checks</a>. An aspect is always bound to something. Be it a player, a NPC, an object or even a zone. Be creative with aspects. Try to bind their effects to the value and they should stay balanced enough.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org19a0218" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org19a0218">Creating an Aspect</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org19a0218">
<p>
An aspect can be created at any time by the GM. It can also be created by any player, NPC or even object. To create an aspect all but the GM need to make a check. The aspect points (AP) from this check can be used to create an aspect. Increasing an aspects value by 1 costs 1 point. The description of the aspect can be decided freely. 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org749e7c1">
Arthur the mage wants to enflame the gras around him to channel the enemies into a one on one battle with his Companions. The GM likes this idea and creates the aspect "Dry Grass 1" that Arthur can use. Arthur decides to cast his spell, succeeds with 3 AP, and creates the aspect "Wall of Fire 3". Now any enemy has to either go around the wall or get burned. If an enemy tires to jump through, they have to roll on it against the Fires 3 dice. If the fire succeeds they get burned.
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf68fa2c" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgf68fa2c">Using Aspects</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgf68fa2c">
<p>
Whenever it makes narrative sense an aspect can be used. When used an aspect adds its value to the number of points that can be used for a check. It is also possible to call out an aspect to be used to hinder a check. Then the value is subtracted from the points instead. An aspect can both be used for actions and reactions but never at the same time. If you use aspects in a contest make sure that aspects are not used more than once per round by a character or their points are distributed over different actions.

<h5 id="orgbd69892">Area Aspects</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgbd69892">
<p>
An aspect can affect a zone. This means it can be invoked for all in the zone. To create such an aspect costs double the points. Exceptions may be made by the GM.

An aspect can be over within a round or it can last longer. Normally aspects last at least a scene long. If your aspect should last longer it should cost double. If it should only last for a round the costs half. Exceptions may be made by the GM. In general it can be said, that an aspect lasts as long as it makes sense.

<h5 id="orgb017c3a">Acting Aspects</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb017c3a">
<p>
Sometimes an aspect should perform actions on its own. Each round they can act like any other player or NPC. They use their value for their actions.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org795b671">
Poison Cloud 2: Each round it tries to use 2 dice to poison any inside. Since it impacts a zone it can do this for everyone inside the zone every round.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8007126">
<p>
An aspect can have resistance to being removed. The resistance is subtracted from any attempt to removing this aspect. For each point of resistance costs 1. The effective resistance can never be more than the aspects value. Be creative when invoking a resistant aspect. For example armor could be implemented as an aspect with resistance.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge1dfc4b">
A heavy door blocks the way. The GM creates the aspect "Fortified Door 5[2]". This means the aspect has a value of 5 with a resistance of 2. The players try to break through with pure strength. On their first try they get 4 AP. 2 get absorbed by the doors resistance and the rest weakens the door. The door s aspect is now "Fortified Door 3[2]". On their second try the players get 6 AP and break throgh.
If the players had decided to pick the lock the GM may had ignored the restistance value.

Aspects are also used to represent damage a character or object has taken. If a character is unable to act in a scene because too many aspects hinder him, it is a good idea to narrate them out of the scene.

<p>
The prototypical contest is combat, but the same rules can be used any scenario where multiple parties act in opposition to each other. Be it a diplomatic debate or the hostile takeover of a company. 
</p>

<p>
A contest is divided into rounds. Each participant in the contest can make one or more actions each round. When it is a participants turn or on any later point in the round they can perform an action.

<h5 id="org606f0ba">Actions</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org606f0ba">
<p>
An action is a check that tries to create an aspect. Any kind of aspect can be created, based on what fits the scene. You can try to gain an advantageous position, or start a big fire.
</p>

<p>
If in combat the aspect that is created it is by default <code>stress</code>. If a character has more <code>stress</code> than he has points in an attribute, then  he can not use this attribute any more. Once the scene ends the stress is converted to one or multiple negative aspects like wounds or exhaustion.

<p>
Whenever someone takes an action and has rolled his dice anyone else can immediately try to perform a reaction to prevent it. A reaction does not by its nature create an aspect. If you announce this before the action is rolled you can take the average on a reaction. You have to announce the number of dice invested. The points from the reaction are then subtracted from the points of the action to lessen its effect.

Each round you can take multiple actions and reactions. The total number of points gained from the attributes is the largest attribute value of the checks.

Traits are distinguishing things about the character that allow him to break a rule of the world or the game in some way. For example with the Trait Night Vision you can just see in the dark. No rolls required. Some traits (like all magic) should come with a risk, meaning all checks that can only be made with this trait are risky checks. They can be bought for character points, this is possible both at character creation and later in the game.

Sometimes it is useful to draw maps and define distances. In a contest split the area into roughly 3-5 zones. A character can move from one zone to another each round.

<p>
Items have a description and a resource value (RV). The RV is an abstraction for the items price or usefulness. 
Items may have an aspect associated with them. If you want items to have any specific effects you may add aspects. At any time the GM can choose to give an item an aspect. Normally it will have the resource value of the item in AP. You don't have to write down the obvious aspects an item has. For example you dont need to specify that the sword is good for slicing stuff.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6814f04">
<p>
There is no Armor but some aspects can act as such. If an aspect can be used in a defensive (re)action, this effectively reduces the amount of AP of the attack. Thus they act like armor. Think of armor items as having the protective aspect on them. If an aspect can be used is up to the GM. So he can decide that the very expensive ballgown can not be used to defend against a bullet.

<p>
When out adventuring characters have all the gear that they have written down. Additionally they can be allowed to make a Gear check against the RV of what they would like to have in the moment to see if they do.

Magic gives a huge narrative flexibility to explain aspects. To balance this out any checks made using magic should be considered risky.

<h3 id="org47c54c2"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Gameplay Notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Since aspects can appear, disappear and change frequently during play, it is good to write them down and show them to your players. For this i suggest to use post-it notes. This has the nice effect that you can give your players something physical that represents the advantages they created or can use.
</p>

<h3 id="org7d20018"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Character Creation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
When creating a character you should adhere to the following advice:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No attribute above 6</li>
<li>No attribute below 2</li>
<li>Have 1 aspect describing what you want to be good at</li>
<li>Have 1 aspect describing how you make your living</li>
<li>Have 1 aspect describing what you like to do as a hubby</li>
<li>Forumlate your traits such that they can be interpreted as a vulnerability</li>
<li>Have at least 1 trait</li>
</ul>
<p>
Break these rules as you like.

<h3 id="orga6e616c"><span class="section-number-3">5.3.</span> Encounter Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
To design a good challenge count the total of attributes and aspects the players could bring to the fight and match this with those of the opponents roughly 1:1.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sum the CP of your player characters</li>
<li>divide the sum by 100</li>
<li>multiply this with 3</li>
<li>The result is a good estimate for how hard a challenge should be.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A rough estimate can be to divide the sum of all your players CP by 100 and multiply this by 3.
</p>

<p>
Let your players become creative and create aspects to help them better their odds.
</p>

<p>
Try to give any noteworthy opponent an advantageous and a disadvantageous aspect.

<b>GM</b> is the Game Master Mathew controlling the 3 goblins (P: 2, M; 1, S: 1, Life of Banditry 1)
</p>

<p>
<b>A</b> is the player Anna with her character Amy (P: 3,M: 6,S: 4, Proud member of the Alchemists Guild of Mistwater 3)
</p>

<p>
<b>B</b> is the player Ben with his character Boris (P: 6,M: 4,S: 3, Best Fighter of his tribe and wrestling champion 3, Member of the isolated Nomads of the eastern steppes 2)
</p>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> As you walk along the forest trail please roll for perception with your will.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GM rolls 6d = 4 for the 3 goblins trying to ambush</li>
<li>A rolls 4d =  4</li>
<li>B rolls 6d = 10</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> You notice a shuffling in the bushes before you reach the choke-point. You exchange a quick look with one another and know that the Goblins must be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>B:</b> I try to intimidate the goblins in order to prevent them from attacking us. I step forward as if there was nothing there and say to Amy "Remember the Wivern we killed last week. Turns out it ate one of the royal knights. What total weaklings they must have been. I mean we ripped that lizards fucking head of without breaking a sweat."
</p>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> roll for intimidation with charisma, you can use your barbarian aspect for it. The story sounds very much like what a barbarian would do.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>B rolls 6d = 2</li>
<li>GM rolls 3d = 5</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> They block with their empathy. Sorry Ben, the goblins are not convinced. They jump out of the bushes.
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> Can i have prepared a smoke bomb?
</p>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> Ok, make a retroactive check for your alchemy.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A rolls 9d = 6 with an "and"</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>A:</b> It should cover an area with smoke. For the and, how about it also causes coughing.
</p>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> Sounds good. As i said the goblins jump out of the bushes and attack, still thinking that you don't expect them. Lets start the turn order. Anna, Ben you go first. Since you have equal values decide among yourself who begins.
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> I throw the bomb at them. I use 1d and the smoke bomb. I want it to cover a zone.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A rolls 7d = 5 =&gt; the smoke aspect has strength 5/2 = 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> The goblins dont expect this and dont try to defend. I will add "covered in irritating smoke 2" to them.
</p>

<p>
<b>B:</b> I attack with my axe. I use 3 of my strength dice and my fighting aspect.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>B rolls 6d = 0 "and"</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> During the attack you step partially into the smoke and breathe in some of it. I give you the aspect "coughing 2". The goblins attack. They rolled 5 please defend ben.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GM rolls 9d-2d = 7d = 5</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>A:</b> I want to assist in bens defense.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A rolls 2d = 3</li>
<li>B rolls 6d-2d = 4d = 3</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> Together you manage to defend with 6 against 5. Next round. It is your turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>B:</b> I attack
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>B rolls 4d + 3 = 9</li>
<li>GM rolls 7d = 4</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> You kill two of them outright.
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> I attack the remaining one.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A rolls 3d = 1</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> After this. He will try to flee.
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> "Let him run"
</p>

<p>
<b>GM:</b> The goblin runs away and soon the smoke dissipates and the street is silent once more.

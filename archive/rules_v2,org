** Variant 2
*** Contests

Contests are there to decide how situations play out if the outcome is not initially clear. This are often conflicts. Not necessarily violent ones though.
Like in other Systems contests are divided up into rounds. 
Different than in other systems though everyones actions happen at the same time. What happens during one round is only decided in the very last phase of the contest.

Also different than in many other systems contests may be communal, meaning that every character adds to the success of his party directly.

*** Phases
There are 1 or more rounds of contest. Each round takes an indeterminate ammount of [[*Time][time]]. Each round is divided into phases.

**** Phase 1: Declaration of actions
From the character with the lowest to the player with the highest [[*Initiative][initiative]], everyone declares what his [[*Action][action]] is going to be. The [[*Attributes][attribute]] that is rolled on and helping [[*Modifier][modifiers]] are all decided on. 
The ordering gives players with a higher (better) initiative the option do react on the decisions of the others.

**** Phase 2: Rolling the dice
Now every character rolles his dice. 

**** Phase 3: Evaluation of the dice
[[*Modifier][Modifiers]] are applied to the dice and they are evaluated. It might be necessary to roll some more dice. Each character has a number of successes at his disposal. All parties decide how many of these successes they want to use against the other party and how many they want to use in order to defend themselves. Each attacking success that is not negated by a defense success is going to reduce the [[*Situation Value (SV)][Situation  Value (SV)]] by one. 

An action only has any [[*Effect][effect]] if it was successfull.

**** Phase 4: Description of the results
Depending on the successfull actions and the resulting change in SV the game master describes how the round plays out and what the results are. often there was a signifficant change to the conflict that might apply some lasting [[*Modifier][modifiers]] to the situation.

*** Action
An action is whatever a person tries to accomplish. An action can be invented on the spot or be given roules by an item, feat, or anything else. Most actions just add their successes to the contest, but some are difficult and may fail. They will only add their successes if at least a certain ammout is reached.

An Action is rolled on an Attribute. This means that the base number of (six sided) dice being used is determined by the Attribute. A rolled die is normally considered a success if it shows a 5 or 6. This is the standard success range of 2 (the two highest numbers are a success). Only the number of successes matter in the end. 

*** Effect

An effect can be anything. It is something that is caused by an action. It is described in free text form or just implied by the description. It can also add modifiers to all following actions in the contest. 

For example:
The party is in a firefight. 
Player A: shoots at the opponents
Player B: uses his strength to flip a table and create cover for his group
Player C: also shoots at the opponents. 
Player B can use his successes to win the contest as normal but additionally now he and his colleges have cover. The game master grants them an increase of one for the successranage if the roll is used to defend (negate enemy successes)

*** Modifier

Modifiers are changes to how an action is rolled. They always impact the dice rolls and how the succeses are evaluated. They can be whatever you can think of. An extreme example would be 

#+begin_example
On a full moon you may roll one dice more.
One 5 being rolled has to be rerolled.
The Successrange is reduced by one. 
#+end_example

Modifiers can stack with one another. If the order sould ever matter use the most advantageous one. 

Here is a non exaustive list of examples of Modifiers
- Successrange (SR) increased or decreased by one
- Reroll a die
- Reroll a die and take the higher/lower
- Roll one more or less dice
- Reroll a die if it shows a certain number
- Increase/decrease the number of one die by one


*** Situation  Value (SV)
This value is initially the total sum of the levels of a party. This value represents the inital situation and resiliency of the group. Once the Value sinks to 0 the party has lost the conflict. How this loss is represented in game is up to the game master, and should reflect the intentions of the party and their opponents. For example a beaten group of guards might flee from the szene if their situation value sinks to 0, or one from the group of adventurers is eaten if the mountain beast succeeds in his hunt.

*** Time

A round is as long as is usefull to the story. In a sniper battle or the court of law a round might take hours or days while in a knivefight it might encompass a couple of seconds. I advice to not assign any defined length to a round. They dont even need to be of the same length inside a contest.

*** Contests against inanimate objects or circumstances

A party in a contest does not have to have any agency. For example a spiked pit trap be such a party. 
For inanimate partys you can forego rolling dice but instead take a fixed result. Players should still roll their dice against this in most cases. 


*** Initiative
The initiatve determines the order of the characters in combat. The higher the initiative the better. In most conflicts the initiative is the sum of perception and willpower, this is a measure of awareness and decisiveness. The GM can also determine that the initiative should be generated differently for a contest.
